## Regression Prediction Problem
## Data/ 

## Overview 
contains original `train_regression` data (derived from the Kaggle Competition) and it's codebook; cleaned, testing, training, and folds for `train_regressionn` dataset

## Files

- `train_regression.csv`: original train data derived from Kaggle competition
- `test.rda`: cleaned testing data set 
- `test_regression.rda`: original test data derived from Kaggle competition 
- `test_regression.csv`: original test data derived from Kaggle competition
- `split.rda`: splitting for `train_train` and `train_test`
